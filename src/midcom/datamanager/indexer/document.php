/**
 * This class is geared to ease indexing of datamanager driven documents. The
 * user invoking the indexing must have full read permissions to the object.
 *
 * <b>Basic indexing operation</b>
 *
 * This class uses a number of conventions, see below, to merge an existing
 * datamanager driven document into an indexing capable document. It requires
 * the callee to instantiate the datamanager, as this class would have no
 * idea where to take the schema database from.
 *
 * The RI (the GUID) from the base class is left untouched.
 *
 * <b>Indexing field defaults:</b>
 *
 * Unless you specify anything else explicitly in the schema,
 * the class will merge all text based fields together to form the <i>content</i>
 * field of the index record, to allow for easy searching of the document.
 * This will *not* include any metadata like keywords or summaries.
 *
 * If the schema contains a field <i>abstract</i>, it will also be used as
 * abstract field for the indexing process. In the same way, fields named
 * <i>title</i> or <i>author</i> will be used for the index document's title
 * or author respectively. The contents of abstract, title and author will also
 * be appended to the content field at the end of the object construction,
 * easing searching over this fields.
 *
 * If no abstract field is present, the first 200 characters of the content
 * area are used instead.
 *
 * Not all types can be indexed, check the various types in question about their
 * indexing capabilities. In general, if the system should index any non-text
 * field, it will use the CSV representation for implicit conversion.
 *
 * Metadata processing is done by the base class.
 *
 * <b>Document title:</b>
 *
 * You should either have an auto-indexed title field, or an assortment
 * of other fields manually assigned to index to the title field.
 *
 * <b>Configurability using the Datamanager schema:</b>
 *
 * You can decorate datamanager fields with various directives influencing
 * the indexing. See the Datamanager's schema documentation for details.
 * Basically, you can choose from the following indexing methods using the
 * key 'index_method' for each field:
 *
 * - The default <i>auto</i> mode will use the above guidelines to determine
 *   the indexing destination automatically, adding data to the content, abstract,
 *   title and author fields respectively.
 * - You can specify <i>abstract</i>, <i>content</i>, <i>title</i> or
 *   <i>author</i> to indicate that the field should be used for the indicated
 *   document fields. The content selector may be specified more than once,
 *   indicating that the content of the relevant fields should be merged.
 * - Any date field can be indexed into its own, range-filterable field using
 *   the <i>date</i> method. In this case, two document fields will be created
 *   actually. One containing the filterable timestamp named directly after
 *   the schema field, and a second one, having the _TS postfix which is set as
 *   noindex containing the plain timestamp.
 * - Finally, you can explicitly index a field as a separate document field
 *   using one of the five field types <i>keyword</i>, <i>unindexed</i>,
 *   <i>unstored</i> or <i>text</i>. You can further control if the content
 *   of these fields is also added to the main content field. This is useful
 *   if you want to have fields searchable both by explicit field specification
 *   and the default field for simpler searches. This is controlled by setting
 *   the boolean key 'index_merge_with_content' in the field, which defaults
 *   to true.
 * - <i>noindex</i> will prevent indexing of this field.
 *
 * The documents type is "midcom_datamanager".
