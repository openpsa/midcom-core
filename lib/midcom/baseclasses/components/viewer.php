/**
 * Base class to encapsulate the component's routing, instantiated by the MidCOM
 * component interface.
 *
 * It provides an automatic mechanism for URL processing and validation, minimizing
 * the required work to get a new component running.
 *
 * <b>Request switch configuration</b>
 *
 * The class uses an array which aids in URL-to-function mapping. Handlers are distinguished
 * by the "URL-space" they handle. For each handler, one function is needed for the
 * request handling ("Handle Phase") and optionally one for output ("Output Phase"). These handlers refer to
 * another class which gets instantiated if necessary.
 *
 * All request handlers are contained in a single array, whose keys identify the various switch
 * configurations. These identifiers are only for informational purposes (they appear in the
 * debug log), so you could just resort to automatic array index numbering using the []
 * operator.
 *
 * Each request handler definition in the switch must contain these key/value pairs:
 *
 * - <b>mixed fixed_args:</b> This is either a string or an array and defines the fixed
 *   arguments that have to be present at the beginning of the URL to be handled. A
 *   string denotes a single argument, an array is used if more than one fixed argument
 *   is needed. If you do not have any fixed arguments, set this parameter to null, which
 *   is the default.
 * - <b>int variable_args:</b> Usually, there are a number of variables in the URL, like
 *   article IDs, or article names. This can be 0, indicating that no variable arguments are
 *   required, which is the default. For an unlimited number of variable_args set it to -1.
 *
 * - <b>mixed handler:</b> This is a definition of what method should be invoked to
 *   handle the request using the callable array syntax. The first array member must contain
 *   the name of an existing class.
 *   This value has no default and must be set. The actual methods called will have either an
 *   _handler_ or _show_ prefix.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * <code>
 * $this->_request_switch[] = [
 *     'fixed_args' => ['registrations', 'view'],
 *     'variable_args' => 1,
 *     'handler' => ['net_nemein_registrations_regadmin', 'view']
 * ];
 * </code>
 *
 * This definition is usually located in either in the routes.yml file (preferred)
 * or the _on_initialize event handler.
 *
 * The handlers are processed in the order which they have been added to the array. This has
 * several implications:
 *
 * First, if you have two handlers with similar signatures, the latter might be hidden by the
 * former, for example the handler 'view' with two variable arguments includes the urls that
 * could match 'view', 'registration' with a single variable argument if processed in this order.
 * In these cases you have to add the most specific handlers first.
 *
 * Second, for performance reasons, you should try to add the handler which will be accessed
 * most of the time first (unless it conflicts with the first rule above), as this will speed
 * up average request processing.
 *
 * It is recommended that you add string-based identifiers to your handlers. This makes
 * debugging of URL parsing much easier, as MidCOM logs which request handlers are checked
 * in debug mode. The above example could use something like
 * `$this->_request_switch['registrations-view']` to do so. Just never prefix one of your
 * handlers with one underscores, this namespace is reserved for MidCOM usage.
 *
 * <b>Callback method signatures</b>
 *
 * <code>
 * /**
 *  * Exec handler example, with Docblock:
 *  * @param string $handler_id The ID of the handler.
 *  * @param array $args The argument list.
 *  * @param array $data The local request data.
 *  {@*}
 * public function _handler_xxx (string $handler_id, array $args, array &$data) {}
 *
 * /**
 *  * Show handler example, with Docblock:
 *  * @param string $handler_id The ID of the handler.
 *  * @param array $data The local request data.
 *  {@*}
 * public function _show_xxx (string $handler_id, array &$data) {}
 * </code>
 *
 * The two callbacks match the regular processing sequence of MidCOM.
 *
 * The main callback _handle_xxx is mandatory, _show_xxx is optional since the handle method can
 * return a response directly.
 *
 * As you can see, the system provides you with an easy way to keep track of the data
 * of your request, without having dozens of members for trivial flags. This data array
 * is automatically registered in the custom component context under the name
 * 'request_data', making it easily available within style elements as $data
 *
 * The data array can also be accessed by using the $_request_data member of this class,
 * which is the original data storage location for the request data.
 *
 * Note that the request data, for ease of use, already contains the L10n
 * Databases of the Component and MidCOM itself located in this class. They are stored
 * as 'l10n' and 'l10n_midcom'. Also available as 'config' is the current component
 * configuration and 'topic' will hold the current content topic.
 *
 * <b>Automatic handler class instantiation</b>
 *
 * If you specify a class name instead of a class instance as an exec handler, MidCOM will
 * automatically create an instance of that class type and initialize it. These
 * so-called handler classes must be a subclass of midcom_baseclasses_components_handler.
 *
 * The subclasses you create should look about this:
 *
 * <code>
 * class my_handler extends midcom_baseclasses_components_handler
 * {
 *     public function _on_initialize()
 *     {
 *         // Add class initialization code here, all members have been prepared
 *     }
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * The two methods for each handler have the same signature as if they were in the
 * same class.
