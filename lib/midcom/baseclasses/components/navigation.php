/**
 * Base class to encapsulate a NAP interface. Does all the necessary work for
 * setting the object to the right topic. You just have to fill the gaps for
 * getting the leaves and node data.
 *
 * Normally, it is enough if you override the members get_leaves() and get_node().
 * You usually don't even need to write a constructor, as the default one should
 * be enough for your purposes. If you need extra initialization work done when
 * "entering" a topic, use the event handler _on_set_object().
