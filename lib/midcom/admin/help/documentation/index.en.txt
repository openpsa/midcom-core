On-line help reader
=====

On-line help reader is a MidCOM plugin that reads component's documentation 
folder in order to present on-line help regarding current component.

It can be invoked several ways:

 * /__ais/help/ - presents help index for current topic's copmponent
 * /__ais/help/*component* - presents help index for *component*
 * /__ais/help/*component*/*help_id* - presents contents of *help_id*.*lang*.txt documentation file
 
There is also a special *help_id* named **routes** that lists all available 
URL routes supported by component. Currently this feature is available only 
for current component view. 

Request Handler class adds a special *request_switch* key item

    $this->_request_switch[$key]['info'] = $this->_l10n->get($key.'_info');
    
to allow include **routes** description in translation file. String identifier for route description
matches the pattern of ***{$key}_*info**, eg. in blog component, for **ajax-latest** switch it will be

    'info' => $this->_l10n->get('ajax-latest_info'); 

**index** *help_id* creates a Table of Contents on the fly by reading filenames in documentation 
folder that match the pattern of *help_id*.*lang*.txt. *help_id* is also an localization string
for translating TOC titles. Help plugin will look for **help_{*help_id*}** string indentifier in 
given component's translation database except for **index** which is a global item named 'Table of Contents'.
Once scanned, documentation files are ordered by file names.

A navigation bar is also created upon scanned items of Table of Contents and placed at the top and 
bottom of each but *index* page..

Help files are parsed using wiki markdown syntax. Refer to [midcom.helper.datamanager2](../midcom.helper.datamanager2/markdown/) for more details.
