Page management 
===
There are several types or pages and all of them have their own characteristic properties (e.g. article, event 
or person information). In this section we will go through the most common features. 

##Creating a new page 

Click on ***Folder > Create default*** article to create a new page. 

Note: Your website might have customized names. Names change also depending on the used component, 

e.g. for Event Calendar there is a link to create event instead of an article. 
Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*)
