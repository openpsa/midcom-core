Approvals
===

Approval is a switch, which is used to define if the content has been approved to be published. If approvals 
have been enabled, unapproved content will not be displayed in the public web site. 

>Note: Approval is off as default and usually affects very heavily the whole site structure. If 
>you are interested in using approvals, you can discuss the possibilities with your site 
>manager. 

Newly created objects will start with unapproved status. Also, when an object is updated, it will lose its 
approval status as well. In approvals it is essential to have the whole parent path of the object approved. 

E.g. if there is a news article called New web site launched, which is located in folder 
**http://www.example.com/en/news/**, all of the following objects need to be approved in order to publish 
the page: 

1. folder en 
2. folder news 
3. page New web site launched 

>Note for administrators: the site root folder has also to be approved. Otherwise no 
>content will be displayed! 

##Approvals in Staging/Live 

Staging/Live is a system, which uses two databases: one for the public web site and one for the content 
production. In Staging/Live old content will be public until new content has been approved. 

This makes it possible to e.g. have a large amount of editors doing their work independently and having a 
chief editor to approve them, as it would be in newspaper production. 

>Note: If you are not sure whether the system you are using is Staging/Live or not, 
>consult your site manager.
