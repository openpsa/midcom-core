Replication 
===

Replication is a tool for replicating the information between two separate systems. Some of the mostly 
used applications are 

1. Staging/Live 
2. Mirroring a website 

Staging/Live 

As described in 11.1 Approvals in Staging/Live, Staging/Live is a system, where there are two databases. 
One of the databases is for public viewing and one is for content production. 

If your website uses Staging/Live, content will be replicated after pressing the Approve button described in 
the chapter 11 Approvals. 

Note: Depending on the system configuration, it will take some time for the content to 
become public. Usually it takes some minutes. 

Mirroring a website 

Mirroring system might be relevant e.g. when there is a heavy-traffic website that needs mirroring servers 
to balance the load. 

Mirroring can be also used as an external backup. 

Mirroring and sometimes Staging/Live usually will push the replicated information into a queue, which will 
be processed in configured intervals. The speed of replication depends on the configuration and times may 
vary from almost immediate to as long as it takes for the information (e.g. when using email interface) to 
reach the destination. 

Replication information 

Although replication information will provide only very detailed technical information, it might give an idea 
if the object has been included in the replication queue. 

Click on Page > Replication information or Folder > Replication information to view the replication 
information correspondingly. 

The most relevant information of the information page is the date and time of the last exporting (or 
importing, when viewing the details of the live site in Staging/Live), which will show when the last 
replication took place.
