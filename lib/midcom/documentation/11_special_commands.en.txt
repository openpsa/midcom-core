URL Methods to the root page
===
The following URL parameters are recognized by the _process function and are
executed before any component processing is done. They all belong to the
domain "midcom", e.g. they are executed like this: midcom-$name-$value.

<b>GUID serveattachmentguid</b>

This method will serve the attachment denoted by the given ID/GUID.
It uses the default expiration time of serve_attachment (see there).

<b>GUID permalink</b>

This will resolve the given GUID into the MidCOM NAP tree, relocating to the
URL corresponding to the node/leaf. The Permalink can be created by using the
key MIDCOM_NAV_PERMALINK of any NAP data array. Upon resolving it, MidCOM will
relocate to the automatically computed MIDCOM_NAV_FULLURL.

<b>string exec</b>

Allows you to execute certain php files directly, in full MidCOM context.
The argument is the name of the component, which holds the script to be
executed. Script files are searched in the subdirectory "exec" of the component.
If you use "midcom" as component name, MidCOM core scripts, located in
lib/midcom/exec will be accessible. The next argument on the command line must
be the name of the script file. Accessing subdirectories is not possible, only
a single argument will be taken.

The scripts executed need to do their own permission checks, they will work with
the credentials of the current MidCOM instance unconditionally.

Example: http://$host/midcom-exec-midcom/purge_deleted.php

<b>string cache</b>

"invalidate" will clear the cache of the current site
