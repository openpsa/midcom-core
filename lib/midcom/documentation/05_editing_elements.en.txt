##TinyMCE 

TinyMCE is a third party open source software bundled with MidCOM and has found its way as the main 
content editor. TinyMCE is a so-called WYSIWYG editor or What You See Is What You Get -there is no need 
for learning any HTML to produce content 

TinyMCE is very easy to use and the user interface is familiar to anyone who has been using word 
processors like Writer of OpenOffice or Word of Microsoft Office. 

>Note: Screenshots were taken with the default configuration for MidCOM. Your site 
>might be customized and the toolbar can look different with less or more buttons and 
>features available. 

This chapter will go through some of the main features and [more extensive documentation][1] can be found 
online.

##Formatting 

Each paragraph has a style assigned to it. This major style can be the level of heading, preformatted block 
or just a plain paragraph, for example. 

To change the paragraph style 

1. Click on the paragraph you wish to change 
2. Choose the formatting style from the dropdown menu 

##Styling 

The basic set of styling tools consists of bold, italics, strikethrough and both subscript and superscript. 

As stated before, there might be more or less of styling options available on your website. 
To change the text style 

1. Select the area you wish to alter by marking it with your mouse 
2. Click on the styling symbol you wish to use 

Removing text style works the same way: 

1. Select the area that already has been stylized 
2. Click on the highlighted symbol of the corresponding style on the toolbar 

##Cut, copy and paste 

One of the most used features in every word processor is arguably copying and pasteing information. 

Since different web browsers have different security and [safety policies][2], not all the methods work with 
every browser. That is why there are several methods available. This chapter goes through some of them. 

1. Toolbar buttons 
 * the first three buttons are for cutting, copying and pasting 
 
2. Right-click context menu 
* right-clicking on the selected area will show a context menu, which shows also the options for cut, 
copy, paste 

3. Keyboard shortcuts 
* Ctrl-X for cutting 
* Ctrl-C for copying 
* Ctrl-V for pasteing 

3. Browser menu 
* found from the top of the screen 
* usually cut, copy and paste are found under Edit menu of the browser 

>Note: The recommended content producing browser, Mozilla Firefox, prevents 
>unpriviledged scripts from accessing the clipboard. It is possible to either use the 
>methods 3 and 4 or to set preferences for [Mozilla Rich Text Editor][2]


###To cut or copy 

1. Select the area with mouse 
2. Perform the wished action 

* click on the toolbar symbol

##Undo and Redo 

We all make mistakes. That is why your browser will remember a certain amount of actions you have been 
performing in the content editor. It is often possible -possibly with limitations, though -to Undo and Redo 
these errors. 

##Lists 

People read 25% slower on the screen than they would do on a printed paper, according to usability expert 
Jakob Nielsen. This is why internet users have developed scanning technique for the eyes: first words of the 
paragraph should reveal the context. 

Lists are easy to read on the screen, since they collect information in small parts and are quick to scan. 

There are two main types of lists 

1. Ordered lists with numbering 
2. Unordered lists with symbols 

To use these lists 

1. Click on the wished list type 
2. Write the list entry 
3. Press enter to create a new list item and repeat steps 2. and 3. until you have written the 
whole list 
4. End the list by pressing enter twice or clicking again on the list symbol 

>Note: To create lists inside lists, click on button from the toolbar. To return to the main level, click on the button. 

##Creating a hyperlink 

To create a hyperlink

2. Click on the Insert/edit link button 
3. Write the information of the link 
* The only required field is Link URL, write here the address 
* If you want the link to open to a new window, you can select Open in new window (_blank) 
from the Target dropdown list 

4. Click on Insert to create the link.

To unlink select the existing, link and right-click on it. Then select Unlink from the context menu.

>Note: A good practice with links is to always write the complete address, which is 
>required always when linking outside of the site domain. If you are unsure of the 
>correct form the surest way is to visit the page you wish to link to and copy the 
>address as it is from the address bar (including HTTP-protocol definitions and all). 

##Using tables 

There are two ways to create a new table: either click on the Inserts a new table icon or right-click on 
the spot in the editor and select it from the context menu.

you wish to edit.

Adding both rows and columns works equally. Either click on the corresponding symbol or select the action 
from the right-click context menu:

* Insert column before inserts a column on the left side of the selection/cursor 
* Insert column after inserts a column on the right side of the selection/cursor
