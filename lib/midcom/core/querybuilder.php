/**
 * MidCOM DBA level wrapper for the Midgard Query Builder.
 *
 * This class must be used anyplace within MidCOM instead of the real
 * midgard_query_builder object within the MidCOM Framework. This wrapper is
 * required for the correct operation of many MidCOM services.
 *
 * It essentially wraps the calls to {@link midcom_helper__dbfactory::new_query_builder()}.
 *
 * Normally you should never have to create an instance of this type directly,
 * instead use the new_query_builder() method available in the MidCOM DBA API or the
 * midcom_helper__dbfactory::new_query_builder() method which is still available.
 *
 * If you have to do create the instance manually however, do not forget to call the
 * {@link initialize()} function after construction, or the creation callbacks will fail.
