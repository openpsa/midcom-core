/**
 * This class is responsible for ACL checks against classes and content objects.
 *
 * <b>Privilege definition</b>
 *
 * Privileges are represented by the class midcom_core_privilege and basically consist
 * of three parts: Name, Assignee and Value:
 *
 * The privilege name is a unique identifier for the privilege. The mRFC 15 defines the
 * syntax to be $component:$name, where $component is either the name of the component
 * or one of 'midgard' or 'midcom' for core privileges. Valid privilege names are for
 * example 'net.nehmer.static:do_something' or 'midgard:update'.
 *
 * The assignee is the entity to which the privilege applies, this can be one of several
 * things, depending on where the privilege is taken into effect, I'll explain this below
 * in more detail:
 *
 * On content objects (generally every object in the system used during 'normal operation'):
 *
 * - A Midgard User encapsulated by a midcom_core_user object.
 * - A Midgard Group encapsulated by a midcom_core_group object or subtype thereof.
 * - The magic assignee 'EVERYONE', which applies the privilege to every user unconditionally,
 *   even to unauthenticated users.
 * - The magic assignee 'USERS', which applies to all authenticated users.
 * - The magic assignee 'ANONYMOUS, which applies to all unauthenticated users.
 * - The magic assignee 'OWNER', which applies for all object owners.
 *
 * On users and groups during authentication (when building the basic privilege set for the user,
 * which applies generally):
 *
 * - The magic string 'SELF', which denotes that the privilege is set for the user in general for
 *   every content object. SELF privileges may be restricted to a class by using the classname
 *   property available at both midcom_core_privilege and various DBA interface functions.
 *
 * The value is one of MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW or MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_DENY, which either grants or
 * revokes a privilege. Be aware, that unsetting a privilege does not set it to MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_DENY,
 * but clears the entry completely, which means that the privilege value inherited from the parents
 * is now in effect.
 *
 * <b>How are privileges read and merged</b>
 *
 * First, you have to understand, that there are actually three distinct sources where a privilege
 * comes from: The systemwide defaults, the currently authenticated user and the content object
 * which is being operated on. We'll look into this distinction first, before we get on to the order
 * in which they are merged.
 *
 * <i>Systemwide default privileges</i>
 *
 * This is analogous to the MidCOM default configuration, they are taken into account globally to each
 * and every check whether a privilege is granted. Whenever a privilege is defined, there is also a
 * default value (either ALLOW or DENY) assigned to it. They serve as a basis for all privilege sets
 * and ensure that there is a value set for all privileges.
 *
 * These defaults are defined by the MidCOM core and the components respectively and are very restrictive,
 * basically granting read-only access to all non sensitive information.
 *
 * Currently, there is no way to influence these privileges unless you are a developer and writing new
 * components.
 *
 * <i>Class specific, systemwide default privileges (for magic assignees only)</i>
 *
 * Often you want to have a number of default privileges for certain classes in general. For regular
 * users/groups you can easily assign them to the corresponding users/groups, there is one special
 * case which cannot be covered there at this time: You cannot set defaults applicable for the magic
 * assignees EVERYONE, USERS and ANONYMOUS. This is normally only of interest for component authors,
 * which want to have some special privileges assigned for their objects, where the global defaults
 * do no longer suffice.
 *
 * These privileges are queried using a static callback of the DBA classes in question, see the following
 * example:
 *
 * <code>
 * public function get_class_magic_default_privileges()
 * {
 *     return [
 *         'EVERYONE' => [],
 *         'ANONYMOUS' => [],
 *         'USERS' => ['midcom:create' => MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW]
 *     ];
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * See also the documentation of the $_default_magic_class_privileges member for further details.
 *
 * <i>User / Group specific privileges</i>
 *
 * This kind of privileges are rights, assigned directly to a user. Similar to the systemwide defaults,
 * they too apply to any operation done by the user / group respectively throughout the system. The magic
 * assignee SELF is used to denote such privileges, which can obviously only be assigned to users or
 * groups. These privileges are loaded at the time of user authentication only.
 *
 * You should use these privileges carefully, due to their global nature. If you assign the privilege
 * midgard:delete to a user, this means that the user can now delete all objects he can read, unless
 * there are again restricting privileges set to content objects.
 *
 * To be more flexible in the control over the top level objects, you may add a classname which restricts
 * the validity of the privilege to a class and all of its descendants.
 *
 * <i>Content object privileges</i>
 *
 * This is the kind of privilege that will be used most often. They are associated with any content
 * object in the system, and are read on every access to a content object. As you can see in the
 * introduction, you have the most flexibility here.
 *
 * The basic idea is that you can assign privileges based on the combination of users/groups and
 * content objects. In other words, you can say the user x has the privilege midgard:update for
 * this object (and its descendants) only. This works with groups as well.
 *
 * The possible assignees here are either a user, a group or one of the magic assignees EVERYONE,
 * USERS or ANONYMOUS, as outlined above.
 *
 * Be aware, that persons and groups are treted as content objects when loaded from the database
 * in a tool like org.openpsa.user, as the groups are not used for authentication but for
 * regular site operation there. Therefore, the SELF privileges mentioned above are not taken into
 * account when determining the content object privileges!
 *
 * <i>Privilege merging</i>
 *
 * This is where we get to the guts of privilege system, as this is not trivial (but nevertheless
 * straight-forward I hope). The general idea is based on the scope of object a privilege applies:
 *
 * System default privileges obviously have the largest scope, they apply to everyone. The next
 * smaller scope are privileges which are assigned to groups in general, followed by privileges
 * assigned directly to a user.
 *
 * From this point on, the privileges of the content objects are next in line, starting at the
 * top-level objects again (for example a root topic). The smallest scope finally then has the
 * object that is being accessed itself.
 *
 * Let us visualize this a bit:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ^ larger scope     System default privileges
 * |                  Class specific magic assignee default privileges
 * |                  Root Midgard group
 * |                  ... more parent Midgard groups ...
 * |                  Direct Midgard group membership
 * |                  User
 * |                  SELF privileges limited to a class
 * |                  Root content object
 * |                  ... more parent objects ...
 * v smaller scope    Accessed content object
 * </pre>
 *
 * Privileges assigned to a specific user always override owner privileges; owner privileges are
 * calculated on a per-content-object bases, and are merged just before the final user privileges are
 * merged into the privilege set. It is of no importance from where you get ownership at that point.
 *
 * Implementation notes: Internally, MidCOM separates the "user privilege set" which is everything
 * down to the line User above, and the content object privileges, which constitutes the rest.
 * This separation has been done for performance reasons, as the user's privileges are loaded
 * immediately upon authentication of the user, and the privileges of the actual content objects
 * are merged into this set then. Normally, this should be of no importance for ACL users, but it
 * explains the more complex graph in the original mRFC.
 *
 * <b>Predefined Privileges</b>
 *
 * The MidCOM core defines a set of core privileges, which fall in two categories:
 *
 * <i>Midgard Core Privileges</i>
 *
 * These privileges are part of the MidCOM Database Abstraction layer (MidCOM DBA) and have been
 * originally proposed by me in a mail to the Midgard developers list. Unless otherwise noted,
 * all privileges are denied by default and no difference between owner and normal default privileges
 * is made.
 *
 * - <i>midgard:read</i> controls read access to the object, if denied, you cannot load the object
 *   from the database. This privilege is granted by default.
 * - <i>midgard:update</i> controls updating of objects. Be aware that you need to be able to read
 *   the object before updating it, it is granted by default only for owners.
 * - <i>midgard:delete</i> controls deletion of objects. Be aware that you need to be able to read
 *   the object before updating it, it is granted by default only for owners.
 * - <i>midgard:create</i> allows you to create new content objects as children on whatever content
 *   object that you have the create privilege for. This means that you can create an article if and only
 *   if you have create permission for either the parent article (if you create a so-called 'reply
 *   article') or the parent topic, it is granted by default only for owners.
 * - <i>midgard:parameters</i> allows the manipulation of parameters on the current object if and
 *   only if the user also has the midgard:update privilege on the object. This privileges is granted
 *   by default and covers the full set of parameter operations (create, update and delete).
 * - <i>midgard:attachments</i> is analogous to midgard:parameters but covers attachments instead
 *   and is also granted by default.
 * - <i>midgard:autoserve_attachment</i> controls whether an attachment may be autoserved using
 *   the midcom-serveattachmentguid handler. This is granted by default, allowing every attachment
 *   to be served using the default URL methods. Denying this right allows component authors to
 *   build more sophisticated access control restrictions to attachments.
 * - <i>midgard:privileges</i> allows the user to change the permissions on the objects they are
 *   granted for. You also need midgard:update and midgard:parameters to properly execute these
 *   operations.
 * - <i>midgard:owner</i> indicates that the user who has this privilege set is an owner of the
 *   given content object.
 *
 * <i>MidCOM Core Privileges</i>
 *
 * - <i>midcom:approve</i> grants the user the right to approve or unapprove objects.
 * - <i>midcom:component_config</i> grants the user access to configuration management system,
 *   it is granted by default only for owners.
 * - <i>midcom:isonline</i> is needed to see the online state of another user. It is not granted
 *   by default.
