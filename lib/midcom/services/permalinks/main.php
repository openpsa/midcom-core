/**
 * Permalink management service.
 *
 * This service is intended to abstract permalink usage away and replaces the original
 * Permalink system integrated into the NAP system.
 *
 * It is fully decoupled from NAP, so objects, which should be reachable by Permalinks
 * no longer need NAP entries. To make the transition to this service transparent, the
 * system still includes a NAP GUID reverse-lookup, for backwards compatibility.
 *
 * The component interface is used to provide a selective way to resolve content objects
 * to their URLs, with some heuristics to speed up lookups if they can be mapped to a
 * topic.
 *
 * The current Permalink implementation limits granularity to a GUID level -- permalinks
 * map object GUIDs to pages. If you have multiple pages showing the same object, you need
 * to decide which one you wish to have as permalink and provide that URL for resolution.
 * For the forward lookup, it is allowed to have multiple pages set the same permalink.
 *
 * Permalinks are always of the form $midcom_root_page_prefix/midcom-permalink-$guid and will
 * redirect using a Location HTTP header. Since regular content pages are created, the result
 * will be cacheable using the content caching system. This obviously means, that if you
 * modify the permalink lookup rules, you have to invalidate all guids that affected by the
 * changes. MidCOM will assume that the resolution of Permalinks to real URLs is stable over
 * time otherwise. You can also set the no_cache flag during the resolver callback execution
 * if you discover that it is a URL you are responsible for but the result should not be
 * cached. See there for details.

     * Resolve any GUID into a fully qualified URL which can be relocated

     *
     * 1. Check, whether the GUID is already known by NAP. In case we have the corresponding
     *    node/leaf loaded, use its linking information directly.
     * 2. Look if we have a topic, in that case, we get the corresponding NAP node and use
     *    it to resolve the permalink. If that object is not retrievable, the lookup
     *    fails.
     * 3. We check whether the object in question has a topic as one of its ancestors. If yes,
     *    that topic and its corresponding component is used to lookup the GUID, which might
     *    fail.
     * 4. As a last resort we have to iterate over all NAP topics to do the resolving.
